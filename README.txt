Ethan pham worked on creating Sorting.cpp, Sorting.h, makefile and report
Kevin Yang worked on creating main.cpp, main2.cpp and report

Our implementation of the algorithms are in Sorting.cpp.
There are two mains we created. One called main.cpp which requires an input file.
The other main is called main2.cpp which will work without an input file but will require user input in asking for the size of list that will be sorted.


To compile Sorting.cpp and main.cpp:
   make compile1

To compile Sorting.cpp and main2.cpp:
   make compile2

To link for main and Sorting:
   make link1

To link for main2 and Sorting:
   make link2

To run program with input file:
   ./main <input file name>

To run program with user defined size:
   ./main2
